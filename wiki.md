## Origin
_Taskmaster_ was initially conceptualized by British comedian Alex Horne, and first introduced
to the public in 2010 at Edinburgh Festival Fringe, the world's largest performance arts festival. Horne sent a series of tasks to various comedians, and presented these to
an audience. The next year, Horne had ten comedians try to complete tasks live onstage at Ediburgh Fringe. British channel Dave bought the rights to Horne's program
idea. Greg Davies was added, and a pilot was released in 2014. Dave hosted the show
from 2015-2019, until it was bought by Channel 4 in 2019, and has aired on Channel 4
since 2020.

## Format
In 2015-2017, _Taskmaster_ series had a variable amount of episodes, ranging from 5-8.
From 2018 on, the show has followed a ten episode format, each episode lasting
45 minutes without advertisements. Each series starts with five new contestants
with a background in the British comedy circuit. Notable contestants include
Noel Fielding, Mel Giedroyc, Sue Perkins (future series), Mae Martin, Frank Skinner,
Frankie Boyle, and Ardal O'Hanlon. What makes _Taskmaster_ unique as a panel show
is that the contestants are consistent through the series. Prior to the studio filming,
contestants spend a few months being filmed reading and executing tasks, proctored by
Alex Horne himself. Contestants are not allowed to discuss these tasks with one another until the studio recording. In the studio, the contestants and hosts view all five (or two,
for team tasks) attempts for the first time alongside a live studio audience. The
Taskmaster (Greg Davies) is the sole judge of the tasks, and awards points from
1-5 which are cumulative. At the end of each episode, the contestants take to the stage
to read and complete a live task. The person with the most points after the live
task wins the episode. On the 10th episode, after the episode winner is announced,
the total series points are revealed, and thus the winner of the series.

## Other Versions
_Taskmaster_ has several other content spinoffs, including a board game, two books,
an app, several localized programs, and a junior spinoff announced in March 2023.
Countries where the show has been localized include: Sweden, the United States,
Denmark, Norway, Finland, New Zealand, and Australia. Tasks are also given to
the show's fans to complete at home. _Taskmaster_ also has special episodes for each
New Year's Day and for every five series.
